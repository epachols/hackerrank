// Karl has an array of integers. He wants to reduce the array until all remaining elements are equal. Determine the minimum number of elements to delete to reach his goal.

// For example, if his array is , we see that he can delete the  elements  and  leaving . He could also delete both twos and either the  or the , but that would take  deletions. The minimum number of deletions is .

// Function Description:

// Complete the equalizeArray function in the editor below. It must return an integer that denotes the minimum number of deletions required.
// equalizeArray has the following parameter(s):
// arr: an array of integers

// Complete the equalizeArray function below.

arr1 = [3,3,2,1,3]; //expect 2.

// find the minimum number of deletions to make the remaining array equivalent.


function equalizeArray(arr) {
// do something
// return an integer designated as the smallest number of deletes to equalize the input arraycd
